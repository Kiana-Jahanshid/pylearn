# 🐸  **Arkanoid / Breakout GAME (new version)**  🐝 🐞 🪱 🐟

> ##  Game rules : 

+ The format of this game is the same as it's default version , but with different design . 
+ Here , instead of breaks , i have used frog's foods , and also  , used frog 🐸 instead of moving ball 🏐.
+ You have 3 lives , and each time your frog passes over it's tiny land , you'll lose one of your lives ❤️.
